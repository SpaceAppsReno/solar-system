# Solar System in My City

The core idea of this project is to build a scale model of the solar system in Reno. The dome of the Fleischmann Planetarium is painted to look like the Sun and, when used for scale, would result in a solar system approximately 40mi across. We plan to show the planets in our space with their relative positions in real time, allowing virtual and augmented reality interaction. There will also be a geocaching game for users to play using their phones.

## The Scale

The originating idea of this challenge was the size of the Fleischmann Planetarium Dome, which is just under 10 meters and is painted to look like the Sun. At this scale, the Earth is approximately 3.5 inches in diameter and is .65 miles from the planetarium. More details (and exact numbers) on the scale can found on the [scaling project](https://github.com/SpaceAppsReno/solar-system/blob/master/scaling/README.md).

## Project Features

### Real Time Positions

One part of our team is working an producing an API to determine the locations of astronomical objects in real time. This will be the core data source for the rest of the project.

### Augmented Reality

Another part of the team is creating an augmented reality app. Users with the app on their phone will be able to see their location in the scaled Solar System based on their location in the city. When the user is near a beacon, it will display the objects's stats, model, etc. The user can walk around and view the objects in augmented reality. This may be expanded to give the option to view the planets and other astronomical objects in the system, seeing how things change based on user controlled position or gps.

## Potential Additions

### Real World Models

One possible addition would be to build scale models of the objects and place them around town, likely as a host-a-planet program for local non-profits and/or businesses. These models would be beacon enabled for the Augmented Reality app and would be placed somewhere on the orbit of the planet in our scale model.

### Geocaching

This would be an extension of the Augmented Reality App, allowing users to track their path through the system and check in at the locations, creating an augmented reality scavenger hunt.

### Planetary Defence

A game which allows users to form teams and attack planets, claiming them and putting up planetary defences to discourage other attackers. Resources for attacking and building could be obtained through mining asteroids, solar energy collection, hijacking freight ships, etc.
