# Solar System in My City

The core idea to this challenge is to build a scale model of the solar system in Reno. This will involve at least some sort of software application.

## The Scale

The originating idea of this challenge was the size of the Flieschman Planetarium Dome, which is just under 10 meters and is painted to look like the Sun. At this scale, the Earth is approximately 3.5 inches in diameter and is .65 miles from the planetarium. More details (and exact numbers) on the scale can found on the [scaling project](https://github.com/SpaceAppsReno/solar-system/blob/master/scaling/README.md).

## Ideas

Quite a few ideas have been put forward regarding possible projects in this realm. Though all of it will be united under the same challenge, multiple projects could be pursued, integrating them with eachother or not. My understanding of the ideas is presented below. Please feel free to expand on these or add more.

### Real World Models

One possibility would be to build scale models of the objects and place them around town. Perhaps a host-a-planet program for local non-profits and/or businesses? Ideally, those would be placed somewhere on the orbit of the planet in our scale model.

### Ingress Style

The game Ingress works by "placing" portals at various fixed (though user submitted) locations around the world. Each portal can be attacked and claimed by a player's faction (there are two factions). Portals can be hacked, attacked, etc. Analogues to these actions could be drawn for our application, where the planets and other astronomical objects are the portals (possibly moving in real time).

### Geocaching

A beacon on each solar system member interacts with the mobile app, registering visitors who get close enough.  At the same time, the app taps data gathered during NASAâ€™s space explorations to deliver the appropriate educational material.  The tool can be deployed in any region as a game, with an award going to the first person to travel through our entire solar system and visit all its major participants.

### Educational Content

Educational content (most easily from Wikipedia) could be presnted about each object, though I think it is important for the project to remain engaging and have re-play value.

### Augmented Reality

This may go hand-in-hand with the Real World Models and/or Ingress, or be standalone. The idea here would be to be able to raise your phone and point it at location, and see the 3d model of the object overlayed with the camera's view of the world. This would allow the addition of things that aren't practical to build, such as the asteroid belt.
