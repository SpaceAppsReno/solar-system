## From Dan Ruby

Attached is a spreadsheet of the planet distances as calculated by me.  Be careful about other scale calculators because they aren’t necessarily super-accurate, in my opinion.  Actually Wikipedia is probably the best source for planet data since it’s updated by researchers from NASA/ESA/etc.

This is the tool I used to figure out what landmarks were within the min/max radius rings from the planetarium: http://www.acscdg.com  I don’t think that’s helpful, but maybe some kind of piggybacking check in so crowd users can let everyone know what other businesses/schools/etc populate the orbits?

NASA’s aggregate Solar System site is: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov
